# Scavenger-Route

## How to Contribute

I am using a free software called \[Obsidian] to edit my files. It is very clean looking, and allows me to visualize links and tags. However, it is not necessary- you can still contribute using basic text files edited in notepad.

### Tutorial thing
Let's say I am in Blind Cliff Cave. I leave the cave and spawn in House Grey Mane. How would I note this?

First, I would create a text file* for Blind Cliff Cave*. You can do this by right clicking on whatever folder you want to store these files in, choosing New-> text file. Name it the name of the location, in this case 'Blind Cliff Cave.txt'

The most important thing to note is the location connections. Eventually we can write down all of the exits, resources, questlines and items associated with this location, but for now, just note which 'door' leads where. 


### This seems overcomplicated

#### Benefits of Obsidian
Obsidian has fancy tagging and linking features that are really convenient for a project like this. Look at the overworld page.

I've tagged locations in Solitude, so you can search for that. The links to other pages are of course clickable too. But the main draw is the graph view, which kind of works like an interactive map. However this project evolves, sticking with plaintext will also ensure we can migrate to whatever in the future. So! I'm using the following format, but I'm open to suggestions. I recognize it would get redudant if followed to its conclusion, with a lot of pairs of files that just point to each other.

general description of door --> \[[New Location]] description of new location door

example:
cave exit --> \[[House Grey Mane]] bedroom door 

If the New Location is out of bounds, or in a dead end, please tag it like this 

general description of door --> New Location #oob
Gloomreach i don't remember-->Shadowgreen Cavern #oob
