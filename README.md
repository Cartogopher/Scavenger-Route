## How to Contribute

I am using a free software called \[Obsidian] to edit my files. It is clean looking, and allows me to visualize links and tags. However, it is not necessary- you can still contribute using basic text files edited in notepad.

The most important thing to note is the location connections. Eventually we can write down all of the exits, resources, questlines and items associated with this location, but for now, just note which 'door' leads where. Ta da! That easy.

### This seems like a silly method

#### Benefits of Obsidian
Obsidian has fancy tagging and linking features that are really convenient for a project like this. Look at the overworld page.

I've tagged locations in Solitude, so you can search for that. The links to other pages are of course clickable too. But the main draw is the graph view, which kind of works like an interactive map. However this project evolves, sticking with plaintext will also ensure we can migrate to whatever in the future. So! I'm using the following format, but I'm open to suggestions. I recognize it would get redudant if followed to its conclusion, with a lot of pairs of files that just point to each other.

#### Formatting for obsidian

general description of door --> \[[New Location]] description of new location door

example:

cave exit --> \[[House Grey Mane]] bedroom door 

If the New Location is out of bounds, or in a dead end, I do

general description of door --> New Location #oob

Gloomreach i don't remember-->Shadowgreen Cavern #oob


\*(If you want Obsidian to view .txts you must use the [txt as md Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/deathau/txt-as-md-obsidian) plugin. I chose not to enfore .md for adoptability.)
